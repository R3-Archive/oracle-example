# Corda Oracle Example

This is an Oracle service and client implementation that facilitates the querying of nth prime numbers and validation of nth prime numbers

Whilst the functionality is completely superflouous (as primes can be verified deterministically via the contract code), it is a useful example of how to structure an Oracle service that provides querying and signing abilities.

TODO:

* Finish inline TODOs

* Need to finish the API
* Need to add some more tests
* Need to add some more comments; e.g. clarity around legal identity key vs advertised servie key
